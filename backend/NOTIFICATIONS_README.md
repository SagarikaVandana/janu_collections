# Order Confirmation Notifications

This system automatically sends notifications to customers when an admin confirms their order. The notifications include email, SMS, and WhatsApp messages.

## Features

- ✅ **Email Notifications**: Professional HTML emails with order details
- ✅ **SMS Notifications**: Text messages via Twilio
- ✅ **WhatsApp Notifications**: WhatsApp messages via Twilio
- ✅ **Automatic Triggering**: Notifications sent when admin confirms order
- ✅ **Fallback Handling**: System continues working even if notifications fail
- ✅ **Admin Feedback**: Admin panel shows notification status

## Configuration

### 1. Email Configuration

#### Option A: SendGrid (Recommended)
```env
SENDGRID_API_KEY=your-sendgrid-api-key
FROM_EMAIL=noreply@janucollections.com
```

#### Option B: Gmail SMTP
```env
EMAIL_USER=your-gmail@gmail.com
EMAIL_PASSWORD=your-gmail-app-password
FROM_EMAIL=noreply@janucollections.com
```

### 2. SMS Configuration (Twilio)
```env
TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID=your-twilio-account-sid
TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN=your-twilio-auth-token
TWILIO_PHONE_NUMBER=+1234567890
```

### 3. WhatsApp Configuration (Twilio)
```env
TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID=your-twilio-account-sid
TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN=your-twilio-auth-token
TWILIO_WHATSAPP_NUMBER=+1234567890
```

## How It Works

1. **Admin Confirms Order**: When admin changes order status to "confirmed"
2. **Automatic Notification**: System automatically sends notifications
3. **Multiple Channels**: Email, SMS, and WhatsApp sent simultaneously
4. **Admin Feedback**: Admin panel shows which notifications were sent
5. **Error Handling**: Order update succeeds even if notifications fail

## Notification Content

### Email
- Professional HTML template
- Order details with items table
- Shipping information
- Total amount breakdown
- Branded styling

### SMS
- Concise order confirmation
- Order ID and total amount
- Shipping status update

### WhatsApp
- Rich formatted message

## Testing

Run the test script to verify notifications:

```bash
node scripts/testNotifications.js
```

This will test all notification channels and show results in console.

## Admin Panel Integration

When an admin confirms an order, they will see:
- Success message with notification status
- Which channels were successfully notified
- Clear feedback on what was sent

## Error Handling

- Notifications are sent asynchronously
- Order updates succeed even if notifications fail
- Console logs show notification results
- Admin gets feedback on notification status

1. **Copy Environment Variables**: Add notification settings to `.env`
2. **Configure Services**: Set up SendGrid/Twilio accounts
3. **Test Notifications**: Run test script to verify setup
4. **Deploy**: System will automatically send notifications
